Arbitrary-HTML allows you to embed custom HTML code without a server. The code is stored in the URL and rendered with a service worker.
No coding experience is required, as the preview is editable by default. I used this to make my [Canvas](https://www.instructure.com/canvas) posts more interesting.

## Templates
### Boilerplate
Basic `html`, `head` and `body` tags, with a script that runs on DOM ready

### Notes
If you have something you want to remember but it's not important enough for a Google doc, write it here. Will persist over browser restarts because your content is in the url.
